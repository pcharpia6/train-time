# train-time

Incoming trains are listed by name, destination, frequency of arrival, time of next arrival, and amount of time until next arrival.

The user may add a new train to the list by entering the information for the new train's name, destination, initial train arrival, and the frequency of train arrivals at the station.

This assumes that each train arrival takes place without delays for the entire day.
